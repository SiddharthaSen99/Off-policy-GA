# Research-Internship
Deep Neuroevolution
** Tasks to be done **
 - Include L(CPI) function as present in TRPO_PPO.py
 - Necessary plots
 - Mutate() and other changes to be made
 - (Optional) Check performance by comparing against not only DeepNeuroEvolution, but also by including L(Clip) instead of L(CPI).
 - Search about the DL convergence behaviour policy in order to come up with a suitable behavioural policy
 - Work in improving the models and figuring out why the rewards are in constant range
