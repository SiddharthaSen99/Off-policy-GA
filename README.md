Deep Neuroevolution
**Tasks to be done**
1. KL Divergence
2. Best behavioural policy
3. Test in various environments
4. Test performance against other benchmarks
5. Implement Crossover instead of elitism
6. Improve the performance of the algorithm
7. Read papers related to crossover

KL Divergence: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_normal_distribution#Kullback.E2.80.93Leibler_divergence
KL divergence Code: https://github.com/chiragsamal/Research-Internship/blob/master/trpo-master/trpo/policy.py

Crossover: 
 - Evolution-Guided Policy Gradient in Reinforcement Learning
 - Collaborative Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning
